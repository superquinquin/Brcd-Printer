## Docker image file

### Docker Linting

We use hadolint to verify Dockerfile linting.

Please see the [documentation to install it](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint).

```shell
> hadolint Dockerfile
Dockerfile:10 DL3008 warning: Pin versions in apt get install. Instead of `apt-get install <package>` use `apt-get install <package>=<version>`
Dockerfile:10 DL3009 info: Delete the apt-get lists after installing something
Dockerfile:22 DL3059 info: Multiple consecutive `RUN` instructions. Consider consolidation.
Dockerfile:24 DL3059 info: Multiple consecutive `RUN` instructions. Consider consolidation.
Dockerfile:68 DL3021 error: COPY with more than 2 arguments requires the last argument to end with /
```


## Python code

### Python Linting

```shell
# First install linter required using poetry
> poetry install --with=dev
# Execute ruff check
> poetry run ruff check
printer/db.py:40:13: F541 [*] f-string without any placeholders
printer/db.py:48:17: F541 [*] f-string without any placeholders
printer/db.py:68:13: F541 [*] f-string without any placeholders
printer/odoo.py:38:33: F841 [*] Local variable `e` is assigned to but never used
printer/parsers.py:6:26: F401 [*] `typing.List` imported but unused
printer/parsers.py:29:28: E711 Comparison to `None` should be `cond is None`
printer/parsers.py:38:14: E721 Do not compare types, use `isinstance()`
Found 7 errors.
[*] 5 fixable with the `--fix` option (1 hidden fix can be enabled with the `--unsafe-fixes` option).
```


You could use the option --fix if you're confortable with:

```shell
> poetry run ruff check --fix
printer/parsers.py:29:28: E711 Comparison to `None` should be `cond is None`
printer/parsers.py:38:14: E721 Do not compare types, use `isinstance()`
Found 7 errors (5 fixed, 2 remaining).
```


### Python safety-check

```shell
> poetry run safety check
